Discord will be our central hub during the event for communications and support. 

You can connect your Discord account on the [Hacker Dashboard](https://chesshacks.dev/dashboard), which should automatically add you to the server. You can then visit the server from [this link](https://discord.com/channels/1427343320484544644).

Make sure you're in the Discord before the event begins! If you're having trouble joining, please see [Support](/resources/support).
